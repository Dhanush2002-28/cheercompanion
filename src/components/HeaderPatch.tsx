// This is a patch file that you'll need to manually incorporate into Header.tsx
// since it's marked as read-only. Look for where the navigation links are rendered
// and add this ThemeToggle component just before the closing nav tag:

import ThemeToggle from './ThemeToggle';

// Add this before closing the nav element:
<ThemeToggle />
